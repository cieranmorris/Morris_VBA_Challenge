# Morris_VBA_Challenge
The VBA of Wall Street - Morris


Breakdown of stock market data over the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. Utilized VB Script to compile ticker symbol for specific stock, their total stock volume at the end of each year, comprised their yearly change in stock price as well as percent change in price. Yearly change in price was conditionally formatted so that positive increases in yearly stock profits were coded in green, and negative yearly changes or loss in profits between opening price and closing price were coded in red.

Used worksheet for loops to apply VBA commands to multiple worksheets. Included in repository is the .bas file containing the VBA code, three screenshots indicated the commands looped through all three years of stock market data with appropriate conditioning, and a README.md file explaining the work completed.
