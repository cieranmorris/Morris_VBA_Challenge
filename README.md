# VBA Scripting - Stock Market Analysis

In this project I used VBA scripting to analyze stock market data pulled from the years 2014-2016. Using these datasets, I successfully rendered several financial analyses outputs relative to company performance including the total volume of stock, yearly changes and percent changes between opening and closing prices.


### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Used this dataset while initially developing my scripts given its smaller size.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Used this dataset to generate the final financial analysis report.

## Baseline Financial Analysis

* Using VBA scripting within Microsoft Excel, I was able to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and output points of interest for each stock including:

  * The ticker symbol

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year

  * The total stock volume

* For an added visual effect, conditional formatting was included to highlight positive changes between opening and closing prices in green and negative changes between opening and closing prices in red.


## BONUS

* Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:


* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

## Submission

* To submit please upload the following to Github:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

  * VBA Scripts as separate files.

* Ensure you commit regularly to your repository and it contains a README.md file.

* After everything has been saved, create a sharable link and submit that to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
